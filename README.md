## Deep Learning Models for Medical Image Segmentation

This repository hosts the implementation and results of our research on employing deep learning models. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using non-expert annotations without significantly compromising segmentation quality.

## Research Overview

Our study addresses the challenges in biomedical image segmentation, particularly the heavy reliance on extensive annotated datasets. We propose and evaluate two methodologies, which leverage weak annotations to produce accurate, pixel-level segmentation, thereby reducing the annotation burden and enhancing model accessibility.
